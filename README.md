# [BLOGG](https://bloom-blogging.onrender.com) - Backend

BLOGG is a blogging platform, which I started working on to learn some web development.

This repo contains the backend code of this platform.

## Technologies used (NPM packages)

- **Express.js**
- **Bcrypt**
- **Mongoose & MongoDB**
- **Firebase and Firebase Authentication**
- **JSON Web Token & nanoid**

##### [Project Link](https://bloom-blogging.onrender.com) - I've hosted this web app on render under free plan so it will fall asleep if no one's accessing the server, if you are accessing the web app it may take some time to load for you depending on your network speed and your location.

##### I did my best to make it load faster.
